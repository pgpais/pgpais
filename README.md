### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis on Asymmetric Roles in Intergenerational Games. Where we try to use asymmetric games to meet the different requirements of players of different generations.

You can check the Child version of the game [here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop-Adventurer) and the Parent version of the game [here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop--Parent-). They're not finished in the slightest but there is some behaviour implemented already
