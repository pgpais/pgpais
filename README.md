### -- Readme not updated! --
I've been very busy with my master thesis and other side projects, so I haven't been updating this readme or my website. Sorry for that!

#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis on Asymmetric Roles in Intergenerational Games. Where we try to use asymmetric games to meet the different requirements of players of different generations.

You can check the [Child version of the game here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop-Adventurer) and the [Parent version of the game here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop--Parent-). They're not finished in the slightest but there is some behaviour implemented already
