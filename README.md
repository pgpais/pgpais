#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro Pais. I am a PhD student, in the LASIGE lab, researching Cooperative Game Design. My goal is to be able to categorise game mechanics and design patterns that lead to cooperation, in order to more deeply understand the impact of particular design choices on the player experience in various dimensions (e.g., Player Closeness, Motivation, Performance, and others).

### Promoting Family Play through Asymmetric Game Design

My first paper as a first author, the product of my master's thesis, is nearly published. [You can view a pre-print here](https://techandpeople.github.io/downloads/Promoting_Family_Play_through_Asymmetric_Game_Design.pdf). Our goal was to create a game that could be enjoyed by a parent and a child in spite of their time constraints (i.e., parents tend to have less time, making it hard to schedule a synchronous game session). We took advantage of asynchrony and other forms of asymmetry in our design to enable these pairs to play. The paper discusses the process and the results.

You can check the [Child version of the game here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop-Adventurer) and the [Parent version of the game here](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop--Parent-).
